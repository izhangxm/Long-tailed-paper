\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose a novel framework that can simultaneously conduct layout detection, character detection and recognition.
Furthermore, we also propose a mechanism to improve recognition performance with the implicit language model.
Experiments show our framework can outperform traditional and deep-learning-based methods. Character-level annotations are more expensive than text line annotations.
